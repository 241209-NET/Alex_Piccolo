## MVP Goals
 - Users can add and update ingredients, including such information as Name and Calories Per Gram. 
 - Users can also add and update meals, including the name of the meal, a list of ingredients used, and the quantity of that ingredient. 
 - Users can retrieve information about meals, such as total calories of ingredients, or quantity of specific ingredients. 


## Stretch Goals
- Implement login/logout and register functionality to allow for multiple users
- Segregate data by user: 
    - Simple: Associate users with meals/ingredients, so users can retrieve a list of meals by the user that created it
	- Stretch: Users can only access meals and ingredients that they have added
